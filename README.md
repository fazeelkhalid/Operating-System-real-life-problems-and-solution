a.	Create a function removeNonAlphabets(char * inputFileName, char * outputFileName) in C or C++ that is passed as parameters: an input file name and an output file name.  The function then reads the input file using read system call and removes all non-alphabets. It then writes the data to output file using write system call. You will need to see open, read, write, and close system calls. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/input-output-system-calls-c-create-open-close-read-write/<br>
b. Place the signature of the function in a header file named util.h, and place the implementation of the function in a cpp file named util.cpp<br>
c.	Now create a main.cpp file containing the main function which calls the function created previously. (For input file, create a random text file containing alphanumeric characters)<br>
